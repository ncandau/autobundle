    Given the history of the computer revolution, it is not surprising that a pantheon of tech titans emerged. While companies such as Amazon and Google control vast swaths of the digital landscape, no one company is responsible for all the technological aspects of our lives. Nor is it likely that one company will prevail over the others. Western users (China is a different story) will continue to employ a range of companies based on what their technological needs are. Enter Autobundle.
    Autobundle allows users to select the companies they use most, creates a single skin encmompassing all the services selected. Autobundle would allow your internet browser, chat services, delivery services such as amazon or food ordering, online shopping and transportation apps to be integrated into a single program. Financial information and passwords would only have to be entered in one place for access to all the applications we use. Users who don't have a company selected for a service they wish to use will be given a list of suggested companies to add to their bundle. Users can also manually add or remove companies from their bundle list.
